# Basic Typescript isomorphic app

A very basic server- and client-sides written in Typescript.

A simple way to use this is:

```
> conda create -n ts_isomorphic_basic
> conda activate ts_isomorphic_basic
> conda install nodejs
> npm run build
> npm run start
```

And point your browser to 127.0.0.1:80.  In Windows, you may get a pop-up asking whether you want to open port 80, and whether it should do this for private or public networks.
